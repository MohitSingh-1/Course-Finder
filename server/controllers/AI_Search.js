    const prompt = `You are a professional course search engine. I need exactly 6 REAL, currently available online ${subject} courses.

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    ðŸš¨ ONLY return courses that you are CERTAIN exist and are currently available
    ðŸš¨ NO fictional courses, fake instructors, or made-up links
    ðŸš¨ Focus on courses launched or updated in 2023-2024 (avoid old/expired courses)
    ðŸš¨ Each course must be from your actual knowledge of real platforms

    SEARCH CRITERIA:
    - Subject: "${subject}"
    - Preference: Recently launched or updated courses (2023-2024)
    - Platforms: Udemy, Coursera, edX, Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, Khan Academy
    - Mix of free and paid options
    - Include beginner to advanced levels

    REQUIRED JSON FORMAT (no extra text):
    {
      "courses": [
        {
          "course_name": "[Real exact course title as it appears on platform]",
          "course_description": "[Real course description - max 80 characters]",
          "price_in_INR": [Actual current price in INR, use 0 for free],
          "rating_out_of_5": [Real rating from platform],
          "platform": "[Exact platform name]",
          "instructor": "[Real instructor name - must be actual person]",
          "image_Link": "[Find real course thumbnail/image URL from the platform]",
          "course_Link": "[Real working course URL - must be accessible]"
        }
      ]
    }

    VALIDATION CHECKLIST for each course:
    âœ… Course exists on mentioned platform
    âœ… Instructor is real person who teaches this course  
    âœ… Price is current and accurate
    âœ… Course link follows correct platform URL structure
    âœ… Image link is from course's actual page
    âœ… Course is currently available (not expired/removed)

    QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
    - Prioritize highly-rated courses (4.0+ rating)
    - Include variety: different skill levels and approaches
    - Ensure all links are working and accessible
    - Use actual course images from platforms
    - Verify instructor names are real educators

    If you cannot find 6 REAL courses that meet these criteria, return fewer courses rather than including fictional data.
